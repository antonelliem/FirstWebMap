# Lab 3 Reflection

#### In this third lab for Web Mapping, I created my very first web map. I learned how to really combine all the tools we learned in class so far like html, java, css, leaflet, and jquery, and have them work properly to make the website. This lab was especially challenging after around a month of not having this class, but the resources from the asUlearn page were very helpful in refreshing my memory. For the route, I chose something I have walked before many times and enjoy. Overall, this lab was honestly a good kick back into coding as I had to pretty much relearn everything in class in order to complete it. With the finished product example provided, I was able to reference it in order to make sure everything was working, and I didn't run into any problems there. I'm sure I'll run into problems in the future and previous webmaps really are a great way to get some code I know works. Looking forward to continuing in this class and I'm excited to learn more.
