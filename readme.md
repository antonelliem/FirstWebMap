# Project Description

#### 
This web map displays a guided route from Plemmons Student Union at Appalachian State University to the Appalachian State University Nature Preserve, incorporating key stops along the way at Tomlinson Park and The Market at Trivette. The map is designed to provide an interactive experience for users navigating through the university’s main campus to reach the preserve, highlighting popular landmarks and convenient rest spots. Starting at Plemmons Student Union, users can follow the marked route northward to Tomlinson Park, a relaxing green space with benches and walking trails. The second stop, The Market at Trivette, offers a quick stop for snacks or supplies. The final destination, the ASU Nature Preserve, showcases the university’s natural landscapes and trails for outdoor activities and study. This project aims to blend functionality with engagement, allowing users to easily navigate from the campus hub to a tranquil, natural retreat while promoting sustainable and scenic paths across the campus.
